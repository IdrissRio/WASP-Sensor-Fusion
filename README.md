# Sensor Fusion
Assignment for the WASP autonomous system: sensing and perception.
## Run it as a live script (Matlab)
You can interact with the scripts using the live script functionality in Matlab.

You can select and change the `settings` data structure directly from this script.


## Run it as normal script (Matlab/Octave)
You can execute the scripts running `error_growth.m` (for task 1) and `main.m` (for tasks 2-4).
