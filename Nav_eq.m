% function call: x=Nav_eq(x,u,dt)
%
% Function that implements the navigation equations of an INS.
%
% Inputs:
% x         Current navigation state [position (NED), velocity (NED), attitude (Quaternion)]
% u         Measured inertial quantities [Specific force (m/s^2), Angular velocity (rad/s)]
% dt        Sampling period (s)
%
% Output:
% x         Updated navigation state [position (NED), velocity (NED), attitude (Quaternion)]
